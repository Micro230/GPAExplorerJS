**Still in development. Not very user friendly.**

Google Photos Archive Explorer is a very simple and lightweight application designed for searching through Google Takeout downloads that have been zipped and stored for local use.

Simply unzip the contents of your Google Takeout and move all of the files and folders from
* {Unzipped Folder}/Takeout/Google Photos/*
to 
* {GPAE Install Directory}/database/*
