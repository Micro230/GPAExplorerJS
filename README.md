# GPAExplorer

Google Photos Archive Explorer, is a very simple application, designed for searching through Google Takeout archives that have been zipped for local use.

Simply unzip the contents of your Google Takeout and move all of the files and folders from /Takeout/Google Photos/* to {Install Directory}/database/*

Still in development. Not very user friendly yet.
